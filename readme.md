This is the **Udacity Neighborhood Map Project**. It's a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood using Google Maps API. It's intended to demonstrate the ability to use an organization library like knockout.js and with Google Maps and third-party APIs provide information about the highlighted locations showing on the map. The styles of the map were taken from the website snazzymaps.com.
